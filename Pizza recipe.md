PROOF THE YEAST-
Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes till the yeast is dissolved 
After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasnt dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive 

MAKE AND KNEAD THE PIZZA DOUGH
Add the flour,salt,sugar,and olive oil and using the mixing paddle attachment mix on low speed for minute.Then replace the mixing paddle wih the dough hook and attachment 
Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough about 7-10 minutes.
If you dont have a mixer,you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand 
The dough should be a little stickty or tacky to the touchif its too weak then sprinkle in a little flour 

LET THE DOUGH RISE 
Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl place the dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it geta coated with the oil 
At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise a slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavours in the dough A quuick fermentation (11/2 hours in a warm place)will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with 
Cover the dough with plastic wrap 
For a quick rise place the dough in a warm place for 11/2 hours
For a medium rise place the dough in a regular room temprature place (your kitchen counter will do fine)fora  8 hours For a longer rise chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours)
The longer the rise(to a point) the better  the flavour the crust will have 
After the pizza dough has risen you can freeze it to use later. Divide the dough in half(or in the portion sizes you will be using to make a pizza)
Place on parchment paper or a lighty floured dish and place in indivisual freezer bags return  to the freezer and store for upto 3 months 
Thraw the pizza dough in the refrigerator overnight or for 5 to 6 hours. Then let the doygh sit at room temperature for 30 minuntes before streatching it out in the next steps 

PREPARING THE PIZZA
Preheat pizza stone(or pizza pan or baking sheet)
place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven 
preheat the oven to 475F for at least 30 minutes preferably an hour if you dont have a pizza stone you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet you need something that will not warp at high tempratures 

DIVIDE THE DOUGH INTO TWO BALLS 
Remove the pastic cover from the dough Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit 
divide the dough in half 
Form two round balls of dough Place each in its own bowl cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes(or upto 2 hours)

PRE TOPPINGS
Prepare your desired toppings Note that you are not going to want to load each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way 

About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza  One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza

FLATTEN DOUGH BALL AND STREATCH OUT INTO A ROUND 
Working one ball of dough at a time take one ball of dough and flatten it with with your hands on a lightly floured work surface 
Starting at the center and working outwards use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2 inch thick turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further 
Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter 10-12 inches
treat the dough gently!
You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers letting the dough hang and stretch while working around the edges of the dough 
If a hole appears in your dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to seal the hole 
Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker pinch the edged if you want to form a lip 

BRUSH DOUGH TOP WITH OLIVE OIL 
Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings)let rest another 10-15 minutes 
repeat with the second ball of dough 

SPRINKLE PIZZA PEEL WITH CORN MEAL PUT FLATTENED DOUGH ON TOP 
Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet)with cornmeal 
transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel 
If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer lightly shape it to the desired dimensions 

SPREAD WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND SPRINKLE WITH TOPPINGS
Spoon on the tomato sauce sprinkle with cheese and place your desired toppings on the pizza be carefull not to overload the toppings or your pizza will be soggy 

SPRINKLE CORNMEAL ON PIZZA STONE SLIDE PIZZA ONTO PIZZA STONE IN OVEN 
Spinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide if not gently lift up the edges of the pizza  and add a bit more cornmeal 
Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven 

BAKE PIZZA 
bake pizza in the 475F oven one at a time until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden about 10-15 minutes if yiu want towards the end of the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese
